These projects are to improve my own front end development skills. they mainly utalize HTML, CSS, and later on I'll add JavaScript and Python. Here are 2 projects. One is school project, and one is my passion project in progress.

## Space Station Site
This is a website I created. It is a one page website illustrating Home page.
It contains, navbar, images, and form.


## One Page I am Power Site
This is also one of my first one-page practice websites. It contains menu navbar, several images, form that can be filled out and submitted. This is my passion project and I plan to develop it into a full working website and a non profit organization.
